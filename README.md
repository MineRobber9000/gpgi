# GPGI - **G**opher **P**rogram **G**ateway **I**nterface

GPGI is a WSGI-like standard built for Gopher exclusively.

As Gopher is a much simpler protocol than HTTP, not much changes. The main changes are to handle differences in protocol.

To see the spec, read [`SPEC.md`](//github.com/MineRobber9000/gpgi/blob/master/SPEC.md).
